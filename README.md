This site was bootstrapped with create-react-app (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and developed using React.js framework.

GraphQL is used for managing blog contents, hosted through https://hygraph.com/

Deployed through pipeline on https://www.netlify.com/

Many blogs are unfinished because I added them to test features. 

I'm working on finishing all the blogs and writing new blogs in my free time.
